libmapper bindings for MaxMSP
=============================

Max objects for libmapper devices and signals. Help patches are included for documentation.

The `mapper` object (found in the folder "old_bindings") encapsulates the functionality of a libmapper device and works as a central hub in your patch by sending and receiving labeled messages from the libmapper network.

There are now another set of bindings (in the folder "new_bindings") which attempt to provide a more Max-like interface to the libmapper ecosystem. The `map.device` object creates a libmapper device as before, but it communicates with an arbitrary number of `map.in` and `map.out` objects in your patch (and subpatchers) which can be used essentially as networked replacements for the internal `inlet` and `outlet` objects. Please load the help patches for more documentation and examples of use.

Please direct any questions to the libmapper mailing list:
