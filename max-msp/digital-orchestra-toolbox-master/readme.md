# DOT - Digital Orchestra Toolbox

The Digital Orchestra Toolbox (DOT) started its life back in 2006 as a repository of useful [MaxMSP](https://cycling74.com/) functions for the [CIRMMT/McGill Digital Orchestra Project](https://www-archive.idmil.org/projects/collaborations/mcgill_digital_orchestra). Over the years it has grown and evolved as it was used in subsequent projects at McGill and elsewhere, including the development and performance of a number of new digital musical instruments such as the [T-Stick](https://josephmalloch.wordpress.com/portfolio/tstick/) and the [Spine](https://josephmalloch.wordpress.com/portfolio/spine/).

Currently, the DOT includes more than 120 tools, and unlike many packages available for extending Max, it consists  only  of abstractions rather than compiled external objects.  This ensures easy cross-platform functionality, and makes the internal structure and function of the tools viewable, understandable, editable and appropriable by users within Max itself.
